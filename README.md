# heic-to-jpeg

This project provides an example in Java for converting [HEIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format) files to JPEG using [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) or [Grahics Magick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/), a fork of ImageMagick. There are two examples using `im4java` and `jmagick` which both use `ImageMagick` or `GraphicsMagick` under the hood. The `jmagick` code does not work, but may just need some tweaking. This has only been tested on a Mac Mini (M1).

## Installation

- Ensure that ImageMagick is installed locally.

## Running with VS Code

- Ensure you have Java installed using the following instructions: [Java in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java).
- Do one of the following:
    - Open up `demo/src/main/java/com/example` and click on the `Run` triangle in the top right.
    - Click the `Run and Debug`, pick from the dropdown, then click the `Run` triangle.
